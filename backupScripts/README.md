# Server Backup Scripts
Contains the backup scripts that are located on the server in their //home/backup folders and contains the cronjob entries that can be accessed using the command crontab -e

Currently not in use: the cronjobs have not succeeded since early 2017 (for reasons we haven't identified). The idea is that these will not be necessary as soon as Kubernetes is up and running.
